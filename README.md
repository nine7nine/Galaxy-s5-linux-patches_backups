# Galaxy-s5-linux-patches_backups

some backups of patchwork for my Galaxy s5/klte, in various stages. 

These patches won't apply (in full, using the 'patchkernel.sh' script), over CM13/KLTE sources because my local kernel
is forked and have some samsung linux/klte code drops that Cyanogenmod chose to not include.

I will probably publish my kernel sources at some point, but this repo is really just a backup for me!
