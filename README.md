# Galaxy-s5-linux-patches_backups

Old backups of patchwork for my Galaxy s5/klte for CM13, in various stages. 

These patches won't apply (in full, using the 'patchkernel.sh' script), over CM13/KLTE sources because my local kernel
was forked and has Samsung linux kernel/klte code drops that Cyanogenmod chose to not include. 

# NOTE: 

* Do not use this repo, as I am not maintaining this branch (cm-13) anymore.

* My Cm14/klte patchwork can be found here:

* The randomized mac address patch requires support in aosp/cm14 builds, more info;
